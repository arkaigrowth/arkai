# **ADHD-Friendly Note-Taking Strategies for a Second Brain in Obsidian**

## **Executive Summary: Top 5 ADHD-Friendly Methods**

**1. PARA (Projects–Areas–Resources–Archive):** A minimal **folder system** that reduces decision fatigue. All notes and files live in just a few broad categories – active projects, long-term areas of life, reference resources, and archive . This limits where things can go (or be lost!), making it easier to *find information later* . For an ADHD brain prone to overwhelm, PARA’s simplicity is a feature: you spend *less time fussing with hierarchy* and more time capturing notes . (Example: Instead of agonizing over which subfolder to file an idea, you’d simply drop it into **Resources** and tag or link it as needed.)

**2. Maps of Content (MOCs):** A **“Map of Content”** is an index note that *clusters related notes together* to reveal context  . When you feel overwhelmed by scattered notes, making an MOC can *instantly reduce anxiety* by giving those notes a home . This method (championed by Nick Milo’s “Linking Your Thinking”) lets you become a “cartographer” of your ideas – you create navigational hubs instead of overloading your brain with structure upfront . MOCs are fluid and non-hierarchical, so you can organize on the fly without rigid systems . For ADHD, this *flexibility* means the system can evolve with your interests while still providing structure when needed.

**3. Zettelkasten (“Slip-Box” Method):** A classic *linked-notes* approach ideal for “capture-heavy” thinkers. You jot down **atomic notes** (one idea per note) and liberally connect them via links. Obsidian’s flat linking structure (vs. deep folders) is especially *ADHD-friendly* – it avoids excessive categorization and leverages curiosity by letting ideas freely interconnect . Zettelkasten provides a **built-in workflow** (fleeting notes → permanent notes) that externalizes your mind, which experts say is *crucial for ADHD working memory issues* . The result is a “second brain” of small, meaningful notes that you can resurface later through links or search, even if your organization wasn’t perfect . (Many ADHD Obsidian users report Zettelkasten’s flexibility lets them follow their interest-driven focus without “falling off the wagon” .)

**4. “Linking Your Thinking” (LYT) Framework:** An ADHD-friendly spin on Zettelkasten that emphasizes  *emergent structure* . LYT (by Nick Milo) encourages you to create **hub notes** (MOCs), make quick links, and use a Home note to orient yourself. The motto is to “make notes at the  *speed of thought* ” – capture first, organize naturally later . By not over-planning taxonomy, LYT aligns with ADHD tendencies to jump between ideas: you organize retrospectively by connecting dots, rather than forcing every note into a predefined spot. The method’s focus on *visual mapping* of ideas (through link networks or MOC tables) rewards curiosity and reduces the mental friction of strict systems. Essentially, LYT combines the best of MOCs and Zettelkasten, offering structure *when you need it* but staying invisible when you don’t .

**5. Daily Notes (Journal Workflow):** Using Daily Notes as a **low-pressure inbox** for thoughts, logs, and ideas. Many ADHD users treat the Daily Note as a catch-all journal – a place to brain-dump tasks, snippets, or reflections *without worrying where it belongs* . This works well because it harnesses routine (one note per day) and requires *no complex setup* to start. To avoid chaos, successful workflows add light structure: e.g. a daily template with sections (Morning, Work, Personal, etc.) and tags on entries (like **#idea**, **#todo**) . The result is a chronological “memory” that you can later scan or query (with plugins) to extract todos and move important info into permanent notes. Daily Notes act as a **scaffold for executive function** – they bridge gaps in working memory by ensuring you’ve captured stuff somewhere . The key is regular review so that gems buried in daily logs aren’t lost (see Deep Dive and Implementation below on how to do this without heavy overhead).

| **PARA**(Projects/Areas/Resources/Archive)  | •**Simple 4-folder setup**– limits where notes live, easing decisions.• Scales to “full life”: you can put*everything*in Projects, Areas, etc., reducing scatter.• Emphasizes*minimal taxonomy*– less chance to hyperfocus on sorting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | • Requires manual upkeep: moving finished Projects to Archive, etc. (may be forgotten).• Not inherently about linking ideas – could become a passive file cabinet if not augmented with tags/links.• Some notes don’t fit neatly (e.g. fleeting ideas – likely all go to Resources).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **8/10**(High) – Low-friction structure, but needs personal tweaks for idea-heavy use. | **High:**Popular via Tiago Forte’s*Building a Second Brain*(many Obsidian users adopt it). Even ADHD users find PARA helpful for “limiting places a thing can be”.                                                                                                                                                         |                   |

Many Obsidian users report MOCs help “manage anxiety” and aid creativity. Now a common practice in PKM circles.                                                                                                                                           |                   |
| **Zettelkasten**(Slip-Box Notes)            | •**Capture-heavy friendly:**encourages writing lots of small notes (fleeting ideas welcome) without worrying about final placement.•**High linkage:**mimics an ADHD brain’s non-linear thought by linking notes in a web, not siloing them. Obsidian’s “everything is connected” approach shines here.•*Flexible structure:*can handle work, personal, all domains in one system – you just link and tag across topics. No need to split into separate vaults.• Proven workflow (literature notes → permanent notes) helps convert jotted thoughts into lasting knowledge bits, which suits ADHD external memory needs.                                                                                                                                                                   | •**Time/effort to maintain:**true ZK involves rewriting notes in your own words and linking thoughtfully – an ADHD user might skip the refinement step, leading to messy notes (still useful, but not maximized).• Possible*over-engineering:*e.g. fussing with ID numbers or perfect link structure – can become a hyperfocus rabbit hole.• Needs habit of review: the value comes if you regularly revisit and connect notes. Without some routine, you may still lose threads (though good search can compensate).                                                                                                               | **8/10**– Excellent for thinking and connecting, but must avoid perfectionism traps.   | **High:**A well-known method (originating from Niklas Luhmann). Many ADHD note-takers swear by it, and*“How to Take Smart Notes”*is often recommended. Obsidian’s design itself is friendly to Zettelkasten (backlinks, graph view).                                                                                       |                   |
| **LYT**(Linking Your Thinking by Nick Milo) | •**Holistic system:**Combines MOCs, atomic notes, and a light framework (often using a Home note and “Maps” for each topic) – giving both*big-picture structure and freeform note-making*  .•**Scaffold for EF:**Provides gentle guidance (through suggested note types like “Atlas/Calendar/Efforts (ACE)” or MOCs) which can help ADHD folks who need a nudge to organize without forcing a rigid scheme.•**Community-tested:**Comes with templates and examples (LYT kit), reducing the friction of starting from scratch. This can prevent the configuration paralysis by offering a starting structure you can then tweak.• Emphasizes*“notes as living ideas”*– which can make note-taking more engaging and rewarding (important for ADHD interest-based motivation).        | •**Initial learning curve:**If you dive into all of Nick Milo’s terminology (Maps, LYT Kits, ACE, etc.), it might feel overwhelming initially. Some users with ADHD reported getting*stuck watching LYT videos instead of writing*(shiny object syndrome).• May still require personal adaptation – e.g. one user replaced parts of LYT’s ACE framework to fit their style. So it’s not a one-size-fits-all – expect to mix and match.•**Not task-focused:**LYT is about knowledge; you’ll need a separate approach for to-dos (by design, since we’re excluding task management here).                                      | **8/10**– High, if you use it as a*loose guide*rather than strict dogma.             | **High in Obsidian community:**Nick Milo’s methods are popular and have dedicated followers. Many credit LYT with helping them find connections and “think better”. It’s essentially a flavor of Zettelkasten tailored to creatives – well-suited for neurodivergent thinkers seeking*both freedom and a bit of order* . |                   |
| **Daily Notes**(Journaling + Inbox)         | •**Low barrier to entry:**just open today’s note and write – no complex setup, great for ADHD activation energy.•**Whole-life integration:**daily logs naturally mix work, personal, etc., mirroring how life happens. This*full context*capture means you’re less likely to omit things because there wasn’t a “proper folder”.•**Built-in review cadence:**yesterday’s notes are easy to skim; weekly or monthly you can review what you logged. This regularity can improve memory and planning (externalizing events, tasks, ideas daily).•**Adaptable with plugins:**e.g. use Dataview to collect all**#todo**items from daily notes, or link a daily note to project notes as a “breadcrumb” of what you did. You can start simple and layer automation as needed. | • Daily accumulation can become*chaotic*if never pruned – important to set aside time to migrate or tag important bits, or you risk a pile of dated notes that feel like “unknown unknowns”.• Some find daily journaling hard to sustain daily (consistency is tough with ADHD). If you skip days, you might lose trust in the system – but remember, you can always restart without guilt.• Retrieving info requires remembering*when*you noted it (unless you leverage search or link them to thematic notes). Over-reliance on chronological order can hide topical connections unless you deliberately connect or review. | **7/10**– Great capture method; needs light discipline in follow-up.                   | **High:**Daily/Periodic Notes are a core feature in Obsidian (many users enable it). ADHD community feedback is mixed: some thrive with the routine, others accumulate untouched journals. When paired with weekly reviews or tagging, it’s often cited as a backbone for an ADHD “external brain.”                          |                   |

## **Deep Dive: Methods and ADHD Considerations**

### **PARA: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive**

**What It Is:** PARA is an organizational system by Tiago Forte for “Building a Second Brain.” It uses four high-level categories:

* **Projects:** active outcomes you’re working on (e.g. “Launch Website”).
* **Areas:** ongoing spheres of responsibility or interest (e.g. “Health,” “Career,” “Hobbies”).
* **Resources:** reference materials or notes of interest (anything you might reuse or learn from).
* **Archive:** inactive stuff (completed projects, closed interests).

In Obsidian, this often translates to four top-level folders (you might also add an **Inbox** or **Templates** folder as needed). The **appeal for ADHD** is the  *simplicity* : when adding a note, you choose from only a handful of buckets, which **“limits the possible number of places a thing can be”** . This minimizes the executive dysfunction around deciding where to file or find information.

**Why it’s ADHD-friendly:** PARA’s minimal hierarchy means you  *won’t waste hours creating and pruning endless sub-folders* . One neurodivergent user noted that **fussing over folder structures is a time-sink** for ADHD – PARA avoids that by giving you a ready-made scaffold . It’s okay if Resources becomes a catch-all bin; the idea is that with Obsidian’s search and links, you can still retrieve information easily without meticulously sorting everything upfront. Another ADHD Obsidian user said their favorite idea from PARA/BASB was exactly this: **“limit the places a thing can be” to make retrieval easier** .

**Best practices:**

* Keep project notes and support materials *within* the project folder while active. When finished, move the whole folder to Archive *after salvaging any useful reference notes* into Resources . (This ensures valuable info lives on in your second brain, while the project clutter gets out of your way.)
* Use Areas for general topics you care about long-term. If you have ADHD hyperfocus phases, you might create an Area for each major domain of your life (e.g. “Psychology Research” or “Home Renovation”). Areas change slowly over time.
* Resources is essentially your **“digital library.”** Don’t hesitate to drop any article notes, ideas, or fleeting notes here if they don’t fit a current project. You can always link or tag them later. The earlier forum advice to **“just tag everything and toss it into some basic folders”** captures this well .
* An **Inbox** (either a folder or using the Daily Note) can complement PARA. For instance, create a folder **0_Inbox** as a default save location for quick notes or web clippings. Periodically empty it by sorting items into Projects/Areas/Resources, or just tag them and leave in Inbox if that works for you.

**Cautions:** While PARA is simple, it’s not a knowledge management method by itself – it’s more about *organization* than  *note-taking* . An ADHD user in the Obsidian forum found they needed to **combine PARA with Zettelkasten** to make it truly useful . They used PARA folders, but within “Resources” they kept a **“Knowledge base” of atomic notes** with citation links (a Zettelkasten-like approach) . This hybrid can be very effective: PARA gives you high-level order, and Zettelkasten/LYT practices give you depth and connectivity.

Also, beware of procrastination via “re-organizing.” As one ADHD blogger wryly noted, *perfecting your folder/tag structure will not magically make you productive* – in fact, “your meticulously crafted system will break down within a week” . The real benefit comes from being able to **find stuff later**, not from how pretty the folders look on day one . So use PARA as a **servant, not a master**: it should simplify your life, not become an obsession. If something doesn’t fit neatly, don’t create a million new folders – stick it in Resources (or an “Unsorted” tag) and move on. You can rely on Obsidian’s powerful search as a safety net .

**Community traction:** PARA (and BASB generally) has strong traction in productivity circles. In Obsidian, many community templates and vault examples use a PARA-like structure by default. Even users who ultimately do a custom system often start with PARA because it’s intuitive and requires little configuration. For an ADHD person struggling with “too many options,” PARA is a comforting starting point – it’s opinionated enough to eliminate analysis paralysis (just four categories), yet flexible enough to hold all your notes. If you adopt PARA, you’re in good company (and you’ll find lots of forum discussions on how to tweak it, like mixing PARA with other methods ).

### **MOCs: Maps of Content**

**What It Is:** A Map of Content is a special note that *functions like a table of contents or index* for a particular theme. Unlike a traditional folder, an MOC is just a note full of links (and possibly brief annotations) to other notes. For example, you might have an MOC called **“Photography”** that lists and links all your notes about photography (gear, techniques, inspirations), organized in a way that makes sense to you.

Nick Milo, who coined the term “MOC,” describes it succinctly: **“an MOC is a cluster of information that maps ‘things’ in context with other ‘things’”** . The key here is  *context* : an MOC lets you see related notes together, which is incredibly helpful for an ADHD mind that might otherwise feel like ideas are scattered everywhere.

**Why it’s ADHD-friendly:** MOCs are essentially **on-demand structure**. You don’t have to plan an elaborate taxonomy in advance – you create structure  *when you need clarity* . Nick Milo advises: whenever you feel that *“tickle of overwhelm”* with too many disjointed notes, **“become a cartographer of your own content”** and make an MOC . This is a perfect antidote to the ADHD tendency to either 1) drown in a sea of ideas, or 2) swing to the opposite and over-engineer a system. With MOCs, you do neither upfront – you just start taking notes freely, and later,  *when confusion arises* , you add a map to navigate them.

Several concrete benefits stand out:

* **Reduces anxiety:** Corraling related notes into a single page can reduce the mental load. It’s like spreading index cards on a table – suddenly you *see* the shape of what you have. Milo notes that MOCs *“help you manage anxiety in a positive way by allowing a dedicated space to place related notes together”* . Many ADHD folks report a sense of relief when they create an MOC for a messy topic – it’s a way to impose order  *without heavy lifting* .
* **Encourages rapid ideation:** With all relevant notes linked in one place, your brain starts seeing new connections. An MOC is a  *thinking tool* ; in that concentrated space, ideas can bounce off each other, which **“encourages rapid ideation”** . For an ADHD creative, this spark can sustain interest in a project (novelty! dopamine!) because you’re literally seeing your own idea web.
* **Flexible and non-linear:** Unlike folders that are hierarchical, MOCs are *heterarchical* . You can have multiple MOCs referencing the *same note* in different contexts. For example, your note on “Mindfulness” might appear in **Mental Health MOC** and **Productivity Tips MOC**. This is great for ADHD brains that don’t think in siloed categories – you’re free to map knowledge along any dimension. And if your understanding changes, you just edit the MOC or make a new one; you’re not moving files around, just adjusting links.
* **No commitment required:** Using an MOC doesn’t lock you into anything. Your notes remain in whatever folders they were; the MOC is an overlay. Milo emphasizes that MOCs are *“non-destructive… not forcing you to use them to access notes”* . This means you can try an MOC, see if it helps, and if not, you haven’t “broken” anything in your vault. For ADHD experimentation, this is ideal – you can continually refine your maps as you figure out what structure makes sense.

**How to implement in Obsidian:** Start by identifying an area where you have a bunch of notes or ideas and you’re feeling lost. Create a new note – for example, **“MOC – Project X”** or **“MOC – Photography”**. Then:

* **Gather links:** Make a list of the notes you already have on that topic. Just using **[[Wiki Links]]** to them. Don’t worry about order initially.
* **Add grouping or headers:** If the list grows, cluster the links under some headings or bullets (e.g. in a Project MOC, you might group links by phase or subtopic; in a Topic MOC, group by theme).
* **Optional annotations:** Jot a one-line summary next to important links. This helps future you quickly recall what each note was about  (one ADHD user mentioned adding a “summary” field in their note metadata and then displaying it in MOCs via Dataview tables ).
* **Link the MOC back out:** In those individual notes, you can link back to the MOC (e.g. at bottom of the note write “Part of: [[MOC – Photography]]”). This isn’t required, but it helps in navigation (and Obsidian’s backlink pane will show the MOC anyway).

Make this process light and even fun. One person called it becoming a *“librarian of your own brain”* – instead of drudgery, think of it as curating a showcase for your notes. Importantly,  *do not attempt to MOC everything* . Use them strategically for areas that matter to you or that are chaotic. The goal is not to have a perfect index of all notes (that’s practically impossible and unnecessary).

**Pitfalls to avoid:** The primary con is the potential overhead if you mistakenly treat MOCs as something you *must* do for every topic. That can lead to dozens of empty or half-filled MOC notes and frustration. Let them emerge naturally. Another pitfall is forgetting to update an MOC after creating new related notes – but even if you do, remember that global search exists. An outdated MOC isn’t catastrophic; you can update it whenever you next dive into that topic. Some users set a periodic reminder to review key MOCs, but you might simply do it when interest strikes (which aligns with ADHD spurts of hyperfocus).

**MOCs in the wild:** Many Obsidian users (especially in the Linking Your Thinking circle) share examples of their MOCs. They vary from simple lists to pretty canvases or mind-map-like presentations. The common thread is that people credit MOCs with **preventing “project slowdown” and overwhelm**  – exactly the issues that tend to derail ADHD folks. By having a map, you always have a starting point to continue your work. One ADHD blogger described using a weekly planner MOC that lists what they worked on each day, acting both as navigation and as a reminding tool to resume important threads  . This is similar to the “breadcrumb trail” concept where your MOC/note reminds you *where to pick up next* – a lifesaver for those mornings when you otherwise wouldn’t recall yesterday’s progress .

In summary, **MOCs add structure at the moment of need**, which is arguably an ideal fit for the just-in-time, motivation-based rhythms of an ADHD mind. They turn chaos into a canvas. If you often find yourself saying “I know I have notes about this but it’s all over the place,” try making an MOC – the relief can be immediate, and the process itself can be engaging rather than tedious.

### **Zettelkasten: Linked Atomic Notes**

**What It Is:** Zettelkasten (German for “slip box”) is a method of note-taking that emphasizes writing *atomic notes* (each containing one idea or fact) and linking them together to form a network of thought. It was made famous by sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who used index cards and cross-references to develop an extensive second brain. In modern PKM tools like Obsidian, Zettelkasten translates to a plain-text implementation of the “slip box”: you create notes (often called **“permanent notes”** or **“evergreen notes”**) and you link related notes via hyperlinks or tags, rather than nesting in strict folders.

**ADHD strengths:** This method shines for ADHD users in several ways:

* **Small, digestible notes:** Since each note is meant to capture a single idea, the writing process is naturally broken into bite-sized chunks. This can help overcome ADHD paralysis—writing one idea per note feels achievable (less daunting than composing a long, perfectly organized document). It aligns with advice to  *break tasks into smaller parts* . Here, your knowledge is getting broken into smaller, cognitively manageable units.
* **Fleeting notes pipeline:** Zettelkasten typically involves three stages of notes: fleeting notes (quick captures of ideas as they come), literature notes (summaries from sources), and permanent notes (your distilled insights) . This maps well to an ADHD brain’s tendency to have lots of quick thoughts – you **capture them immediately** (in a daily note or inbox), then later when focus allows, you process those into more refined permanent notes. The key benefit is that it ensures  *nothing gets lost* : you have a system to convert impulsive jottings into useful knowledge.
* **Linking = context:** ADHD often comes with nonlinear thinking and making connections between disparate ideas. Zettelkasten *embraces* that. When you link note A to note B, you acknowledge a relationship. Over time, you’ll see a web of links forming (Obsidian’s graph view can literally show this). This externalized network mirrors how ADHD brains might jump around, but in the ZK, those jumps become explicit connections rather than forgotten tangents. One Medium author noted that **Obsidian’s flat structure and focus on linking (instead of rigid folders) is particularly beneficial for those who find too much structure overwhelming** . In other words, you don’t have to decide exactly where one idea fits best – you can link it to many contexts.
* **Flexibility and following interest:** Perhaps most importantly, Zettelkasten is  *anti-linear* . You don’t have to follow a preset curriculum in your note-taking. You can build out whichever cluster of notes fascinates you today. Sönke Ahrens, in  *How to Take Smart Notes* , argues that a good system “allows us to be driven forward by our own impulses” rather than a strict plan . This is  *perfect for an ADHD brain* : if your enthusiasm wanes on one topic, switch to another; the system won’t break . Your slip-box will happily accept notes in any order, and because everything is linked, you’ll later find surprising connections between things you wrote at different times, when different hyperfocuses were in play. This keeps the process intrinsically rewarding (discovering connections can be a dopamine hit).

**How to implement:** Start by writing notes for ideas you encounter or have, *in your own words* (to ensure you’re processing it). Give each note a descriptive title (some ZK purists use an ID like 202601171 – but you can just use a clear title like “Time Perception in ADHD” for clarity). After writing a note, **link it** to any other note it relates to. If you don’t have other notes on that topic yet, link it to a more general note or perhaps an index note (akin to an MOC) to avoid it floating alone. Over time, continue adding and interlinking. The real power emerges when you accumulate a critical mass – you’ll start to see a *conversation* between your notes.

**Example:** Suppose you read an article on ADHD and working memory. You make a note “ADHD Working Memory Issues – key points,” summarizing in a few lines. You might tag it #ADHD and #CognitiveScience, or better, link it in a sentence like: “Working memory deficits contribute to feeling overwhelmed (related to [[Information Overload]]).” Later, you have another note about “Second Brain as Extended Mind,” and you realize it connects – you link that note to the ADHD one, perhaps writing “External note-taking can serve as [[Working Memory]] for ADHD” inside it. Now those two notes are connected. In a month, when you’re brainstorming a blog or project, these linked notes surface a constellation of ideas you might have forgotten, sparking new insights. This is exactly how one ADHD writer described it: *“that random note from 3 months ago becomes relevant again when your brain makes an unexpected connection”*  – and because it was in your Zettelkasten with links, you **find it** and leverage it.

**Pitfalls and tips:** The downside of Zettelkasten is that it can tempt an ADHD brain into  *hyperfocus on organizing the system itself* . For instance, fussing over a numbering system for notes, or spending an afternoon refactoring all note titles to a new format (as Ernie from *Little Yellow Different* humorously recounted, renaming files with dates and nearly spiraling into an OCD marathon of file renaming ). The lesson: **don’t over-engineer it**. It’s fine to have a bit of mess. In fact, Ahrens suggests embracing “constructive mess” – the structure will emerge from links, not from force. A messy collection of notes that you can search is *1000% more useful than an empty, perfectly planned vault* . As one ADHD blogger put it: *write the darn notes; your notes don’t need to be perfect, they just need to exist* . So, if Zettelkasten appeals to you, dive in by  *writing lots of notes* . Don’t pause your note flow to tweak the system every second. If you notice you’re procrastinating by organizing instead of writing, step back and return to capturing ideas.

Another tip: maintain an **index or MOC** for broad topics as a complement. Traditional Zettelkasten users often had an Index file or “hub” for entry points. In Obsidian, you might have a note with a list of all notes by tag or category (this can be manually made or generated with Dataview). This helps when you want a quick bird’s-eye view. But even without that, Obsidian’s full-text search can be your friend – the forum folks remarked  *“universal search is a godsend for the ADHD brain”* , so don’t hesitate to rely on it . If you recall even a fuzzy detail, search can pull up the note.

**Zettelkasten for full-life use:** Some worry that a single vault of interlinked notes might mix work, personal, etc. In practice, that’s more benefit than risk. You’ll often find cross-domain connections (the brain doesn’t silo “work knowledge” from “personal knowledge” completely, nor should your second brain). If certain notes are sensitive (work NDA info etc.), you could keep separate vaults, but otherwise one vault is easier to manage for ADHD (fewer places to check). Using tags or a prefix in note titles can mark notes by context if needed (e.g. prefix work-related notes with “Work - …” or tag them). But overall, Zettelkasten thrives on **everything being in one web**, because who knows what idea from a novel you read might inspire a solution to a work problem down the line?

In summary, Zettelkasten offers an **organic, brain-like knowledge base**. For an ADHDer, it provides freedom to explore and reassurance that those explorations won’t be forgotten. It’s not a quick-fix (it requires habit to build), but it *can be very maintainable* long-term because it’s *interesting* – each note added is like adding a node to your personal Wikipedia, and following the links can be intrinsically rewarding. Many ADHD users credit Zettelkasten with keeping them engaged in note-taking where other methods felt like drudgery . If you enjoy connecting ideas and don’t mind a bit of writing, this is a top contender.

### **Linking Your Thinking (LYT) Method**

**What It Is:** The LYT method, created by Nick Milo, isn’t radically different from Zettelkasten + MOCs, but it provides a friendly framework to implement those in Obsidian. Nick’s approach centers around:

* **Atomic notes** (he calls an Obsidian vault of these an “Ideaverse”).
* **Maps of Content** (MOCs) at various levels to provide structure (e.g., a home note, “Maps” for each big topic, etc.).
* A concept called **“ACE”** (Atlas, Calendar, Efforts) which is a way to categorize notes by function: Atlas = knowledge structure (maps and guides), Calendar = temporal notes (daily/weekly notes), Efforts = active work (projects, tasks) .

LYT is basically a holistic system that says: use **Maps of Content** to organize by context  *instead of folders* , use daily notes for temporal logging, and keep project notes for things you’re working on. If that sounds like a mixture of PARA (Areas/Projects), Zettelkasten (linked notes), and Bullet Journal (daily logging) – it kind of is. Milo combined insights from many systems to make a PKM workflow that is  *practical and fluid* .

**Why it’s ADHD-friendly:** LYT’s tagline could be *“harness the full power of Obsidian – start making notes at the speed of thought”* . That ethos of quick capture and quick connection resonates with ADHD needs:

* **It provides a scaffold but not a straitjacket.** Many ADHD users feel overwhelmed by Obsidian’s total freedom (as the user in the forum said, *“already becoming overwhelmed by the flexibility… frameworks from Nick Milo and others… spending more time tinkering than creating notes”* ). LYT aims to reduce that overwhelm by offering some predefined note types and structure (like the Home note with links to MOCs, the idea of an Atlas for your knowledge, etc.), so you’re not staring at a blank canvas with analysis paralysis. But unlike a rigid system, LYT encourages you to modify it. As one LYT follower (with ADHD) discovered, they took the ACE idea but *“replaced the E (Efforts) with a Next Actions list from GTD”* to add urgency that they personally needed . LYT tolerated that change easily – it’s meant to be adapted.
* **Emphasis on discovery over discipline:** Nick often emphasizes that *links are more powerful than hierarchy* for creating insight, and that *following your curiosity* leads to a more vibrant knowledge base. This is aligned with ADHD brains that flourish when engaged, not when bored. LYT tells you it’s fine to have a playful, evolving system – *“your brain already knows how to organize information… stop fighting it”* . By following the energy (what you *want* to work on or think about), you actually end up with a system that reflects how your mind works, which is the only sustainable approach. The above quote is basically saying: don’t force yourself into a framework that feels unnatural; the beauty of Obsidian+LYT is you can shape it to fit you.
* **Visual and spatial components:** LYT encourages use of maps, canvas, diagrams if it helps. ADHD learners often benefit from visual layouts and spatial memory. Even the concept of an Atlas (a collection of MOCs) gives a metaphor of a *geographic space* for your knowledge. This can make the second brain feel more tangible and navigable, engaging multiple senses (visual, spatial) beyond just lists of text.
* **Community support and resources:** There are LYT kits, YouTube videos, and a Discord. For someone with ADHD, having examples to follow can shorten the learning curve (thus avoiding the frustration that might lead to abandonment). The community enthusiasm can also provide the *novelty and stimulation* to keep you interested. Just be cautious: consuming too much PKM content can become a procrastination rabbit hole itself (set boundaries if needed, like *only implement one idea at a time* from the course).

**Key components to implement:**

* **Home Note:** A starting note (often called “Home” or “Index”) with links to your main MOCs or sections. E.g., it might have links like [[🎓 Knowledge]] [[📅 Journal]] [[🎯 Projects]] (using emojis or icons is a Nick Milo signature for quick visual cues).
* **MOCs and sub-MOCs:** For each major area of interest, create a Map note. For example, if you’re into writing, you might have “Writing MOC” that links all your writing ideas and notes. LYT often suggests using MOCs at different levels: high-level MOCs that link to more granular MOCs. This sounds complex, but you can start simple and only elaborate as your vault grows. One known LYT practice is the “Journey” MOC vs “Index” MOC distinction (one is more narrative, one more list-like), but again, those nuances can be picked up over time or skipped if not helpful.
* **Calendar (Daily Notes):** LYT doesn’t neglect daily notes – in fact, the “Calendar” part of ACE implies using Daily/Weekly notes to track stuff in time. In Obsidian, you’d keep using the Daily Notes plugin. The LYT twist is to make sure important insights from daily notes are linked or moved to your Atlas (knowledge base). Daily notes become a staging area for new ideas.
* **Efforts/Projects:** Similar to PARA’s Projects. Keep notes on active projects, and link them to relevant knowledge notes or log progress in daily notes (and use that breadcrumb technique of noting in each daily note what you worked on and where to continue tomorrow  – that can integrate with LYT nicely).

**Real-world ADHD usage:** A great example from *Little Yellow Different* blog – the author experimented with LYT’s structure and found it helpful to categorize notes into the three areas (knowledge, time, action) . They did have to tweak it (they added a more GTD-like task list because they needed that urgency for tasks), showing that LYT can blend with productivity systems. The big takeaway they shared: *the moment they stopped forcing someone else’s system and let their own brain’s instinct shape the system, Obsidian became truly useful* . LYT is conducive to this because it’s *not overly prescriptive* – it gives you a menu of techniques (MOCs, home note, etc.) that you combine as you see fit.

**Caution:** One risk is initial **information overload** – ironically, the very thing we’re trying to avoid. Nick Milo’s content is extensive; if you try to consume it all at once and implement everything, you might get overwhelmed. The better approach is iterative:

* Perhaps start with a Home note and one or two MOCs for things you care about.
* Get used to linking notes as you write them.
* Later, consider the ACE categories: do you need a clearer separation of daily vs reference vs project? If yes, adopt the Atlas/Calendar/Projects folders or tags.
* Don’t worry about doing it “the LYT way” exactly – remember, *your system only needs to make sense to you* . As the forum advised, *“don’t try to organize your entire life according to a guru’s schema… focus on one or two problems at a time”* . LYT offers a lot of tools, but you pick the ones that solve your current problem (be it not finding notes, or not connecting ideas, etc.).

**Community traction:** LYT has a substantial following and many shared vault examples. This means if you get stuck, you can likely find a solution someone has posted (like how to structure an MOC, or how to integrate tasks). The Obsidian forum and Discord might have threads specifically about “ADHD and LYT” tips; for instance, using **Andy’s Mode (sliding panes)** to visually spread out notes side by side – some ADHD users love that because it mimics having multiple papers out (less memory juggling). In fact, the “ADHD-friendly Obsidian theme” we saw in the forum used sliding panes for this reason . This is tangential, but it’s part of the same goal: making the environment supportive for how your brain works.

In conclusion, LYT is like a  *guided version of the linked-note approach* , with just enough structure to keep an ADHD user from feeling lost, but not so much to feel constrained. If you want the benefits of Zettelkasten but need a bit of hand-holding to get started, LYT is worth trying. Just keep it servant to your needs: borrow its concepts freely, but don’t become a slave to terminology or steps that don’t benefit you.

### **Daily Notes & Journaling Workflow**

**What It Is:** Daily Notes in Obsidian are a dated note for each day (often automatically created via the Calendar or Periodic Notes plugin). Many people use them as a **journal**, a planner, or an “inbox” for capturing anything that comes up that day. For someone with ADHD, a daily note can serve all those purposes at once: a single place each day to dump tasks, scribble ideas, vent feelings, track habits – whatever you need to offload from your brain.

**Why it’s useful for ADHD:** ADHD minds are often racing with thoughts and can be easily distracted by new inputs. The daily note acts as a **“low-pressure home for random thoughts”** . Since you know you’ll get a fresh page tomorrow, there’s less perfectionism about where to put something – just throw it on today’s page. This is basically a digital form of the Bullet Journal concept (“rapid logging”) but with the advantage of being searchable and linkable later.

* **Capture without context-switching:** Throughout the day, when something arises (idea, task, info to remember), you jot it in the daily note  *immediately* . This habit is powerful for ADHD because it means you don’t have to decide on a context or open the perfect note/folder in that moment (which can derail you). You simply open Today’s note (keyboard shortcut or mobile quick action) and jot it down. One Reddit user described using a template that had sections for work, home, personal, and adding bullet points under those as the day went on . Tagging lines (like **#todo** or thematic tags) can help sort them later .
* **Externalizes time and routine:** Using daily notes creates a narrative of your life. ADHD folks often struggle with a sense of time (time blindness). Having daily entries can ground you – you can quickly review “What did I do this week?” by flipping through notes, which gives a sense of progress and continuity. It can also serve as a record for things like medication logs, mood, or accomplishments, which is great because memory might not reliably recall those.
* **Integration with tasks and planning:** While we’re not focusing on task management per se, it’s hard to separate notes and tasks entirely. Daily notes are a good place to jot tasks that pop up (and either do them or later migrate to a task system if you have one). Some Obsidian users use the **Tasks plugin** or Dataview to collect incomplete tasks from daily notes onto a dashboard . This way, you can freely dump todos into your journal, knowing they’ll surface in a master list automatically. This reduces the fear of “if I write this here, I’ll forget it.” A common ADHD complaint is *losing track of reminders* – daily notes plus a query can alleviate that.
* **Reflection and review:** Many ADHD coaches recommend a daily or weekly review habit to build self-awareness and adjustment. With daily notes, doing a weekly review is straightforward: open the last 7 daily notes and skim for highlights. Because it’s in Obsidian, you can speed this up – for example, search your last week’s notes for “!” or “TODO” or use a Dataview table to list all #highlight tags you marked. During review, you might extract some items into longer-term notes (e.g., an idea that merits its own permanent note, or a lesson learned that you add to a “Lessons” note). This process ensures that *valuable info percolates up* from the daily stream into your second brain’s structure.

**Avoiding chaos in daily notes:** Without any system, daily notes can become a graveyard of forgotten scribbles (the digital equivalent of a pile of post-its). To avoid that:

* **Use consistent markers:** Decide on a couple of shorthand markers. For instance, *** [ ]** for tasks (standard Markdown checkbox), **!** at the start of a line for important insight, **?** for questions. Develop a personal legend (some borrow from Bullet Journal notation). This allows scanning and filtering. For example, you could search your vault for **!** to find all important lines you marked.
* **Link as you go (when easy):** If you mention a project or a person in your daily note, consider **[[linking]]** it to that project’s note or that person’s note (if you have one). This cross-links daily happenings with your knowledge base. For example: “Met with [[ClientXYZ]] about new proposal – they need figures on ROI.” Now your ClientXYZ note has a backlink showing this meeting happened. This is a light-touch way to connect daily logs to context without manual organization.
* **Set aside processing time:** If possible, spend a few minutes at the *end of each day* or during a weekly recap to process the daily note. Processing means: check off tasks you did, maybe move tasks you didn’t do to tomorrow’s note (or a master to-do list), copy any important info to a relevant note. This doesn’t have to be exhaustive – even processing 20% of it yields benefits. An ADHD-friendly approach is what one forum user called  *“opportunistic cleanup”* : only push yourself to organize when it’s needed . For instance, when a project finishes, then you go back through relevant daily notes to grab outcomes before archiving. Similarly, if you’re weekly planning, glance at last week’s dailies to ensure nothing critical slips through. Don’t worry about achieving inbox-zero on daily notes; focus on *scooping the gold* out of them.

**Tools to enhance daily notes:**

* The **Calendar** plugin (or Periodic Notes) helps ensure you don’t forget to use them – seeing the calendar is a cue.
* **Templater** or core Templates can auto-fill some structure (like headings for Morning, Afternoon, Evening, or prompts like “What’s the one thing I want to focus on today?”).
* Dataview plugin can create summary tables (e.g., a table of all tasks from daily notes, or even a journal index by date with tagged highlights).
* Some advanced users create an automated “Daily Note Review” with Dataview that pulls in yesterday’s incomplete tasks, etc., into today’s note . This can be powerful but might be overkill initially – it’s something to aspire to once basics are in place.

**ADHD-specific tips:** One ADHD Obsidian user shared that *Obsidian maintains the novelty aspect of note-taking* for them in part because daily notes and short entries keep it from feeling like a slog . The variety of writing a quick journal entry, then maybe linking it somewhere, can be intrinsically satisfying. Another tip from the forum: if digital daily notes get overwhelming, some users alternate with analog then transcribe key points. One mentioned using Rocketbook (a reusable notebook) to scribble and then scan to OneNote  – in Obsidian context, you could jot in a physical journal when away from screen (to avoid distractions) and later quickly type the gist into that day’s note. This is a hybrid approach that can help those who like handwriting for focus but still want digital permanence.

The biggest benefit of daily notes for ADHD is **reducing the mental load**: you no longer have to keep everything in your head (“Did I remember to email X? What was that idea I had yesterday?”). It’s in your external brain. And even if the daily pages get messy,  *you can find stuff later* . Search by date, tag, or keyword – something will jog your memory. The Little Yellow Different blog put it nicely: *the power of Obsidian is not a perfect system, it’s being able to find stuff later when you need it* . Daily notes contribute to that by ensuring stuff got captured in the first place.

### **Other ADHD-Tailored Approaches & Hybrid Systems**

Not everyone will fit neatly into one named methodology. In fact, many ADHD individuals end up with **hybrid systems**, picking and choosing elements that work for them. This is perfectly fine – even ideal. As one Obsidian forum member wrote: *“I stopped trying to implement other people’s systems and developed my own patchwork… grabbing from Zettelkasten, GTD, PARA, etc., without being beholden to making it exactly like someone else’s”* . The key is **sustainability and low friction**.

Here are a few additional ideas and principles that have emerged from ADHD communities and coaches that you might blend into your system:

* **Johnny.Decimal for Structure:** This is a lesser-known file organization method where you create ten broad categories (00–09, 10–19, etc.) and file everything within those using numeric codes. One ADHD user on the forum mentioned they use a  *modified Johnny.Decimal for their directories* , paired with an Inbox at the top for dumping new items . The appeal is similar to PARA: it imposes a limit on categories and uses numbers to force sorting decisions. The user highlighted that if they have to  *“think too hard about where a note goes, I’m less likely to take notes”* , so they made the system as straightforward as possible . Johnny.Decimal does that by giving you fixed buckets and a numbering scheme – it’s rigid enough to reduce decision fatigue, but you define the categories yourself (so it can align with your brain’s natural groupings). If you’re the type who likes a bit of imposed order, you might consider this for your folder or note structure. However, don’t go overboard with sub-numbers; keep it simple (e.g., maybe have 5–10 major categories and don’t exceed that).
* **“One Big Inbox” Approach:** Some ADHD users find even categories too much and prefer a single dumping ground with heavy reliance on search. For example, just have an **“All Notes” folder or one giant document** and throw everything in chronological or append-only. Then periodically, they mine that for useful bits. This is extreme, but it’s ADHD-compatible in the sense of  *no organizational demands at capture time* . You sacrifice immediate order for zero friction capture. If you go this route in Obsidian, tags and consistent keywords become important so that search can pull things up. (E.g., always mention “recipe” in any recipe note, so searching “recipe” finds them, rather than meticulously filing them under a Recipes folder.)
* **Reduce “opacity” of your system:** ADHD brains may struggle with things out of sight (out of sight, out of mind). That’s why physical paper planners sometimes work well – because they’re tangible and visible. In digital, we can counteract the “hiddenness” of notes by using *dashboards* or periodically surfacing content:
  * You might create a **“Dashboard” note** that opens on Obsidian start (using the *Startup* plugin or homepage plugin). This could list your current top priorities or links to notes you must not forget. Keep it very short. It acts like a visual cue to focus.
  * Use **pinned notes** or starred notes. For instance, pin your “Inbox” note or Today’s note, so it’s always one click away. If there’s a project you keep forgetting to work on, star its note or pin it – persistent visibility can help prompt action.
  * Consider widgets like **Obsidian Canvas** to make a visual board of things – some ADHD folks like dragging note cards around on a canvas for a more tactile feel.
* **Leverage novelty to your advantage:** As mentioned earlier, one user kept Obsidian enjoyable by indulging in *aesthetic customization in moderation* – they used the Graph view as a cool visual, added fun banners to notes, and occasionally redesigned their home page . This gave their brain the novelty it craves, which actually made them *more likely to use the system* (they associated it with fun rather than chore) . So, don’t be afraid to make your vault *yours* – if adding Pokémon icons or a neon theme makes you smile and open the app more, do it! Just be cautious not to *only* tinker with appearance at the expense of actually writing notes. One strategy is to allow a set “playtime” for tinkering (say, one afternoon a month you update your theme or try a new plugin), but the rest of the time, try to use the system as a tool, not a toy .
* **Executive function “scaffolds”:** Beyond knowledge organization, consider scaffolding the *process* of using the system. For example, if initiating the use of Obsidian is hard, create a routine: every morning with coffee, open Daily Note and brain-dump for 5 minutes. Or use external prompts – set a daily reminder alarm titled “Journal in Obsidian now.” Some ADHD users tie this to another habit (habit stacking). The aim is to reduce the barrier to starting, since consistency is often “the hardest thing of all” .
* **Embrace imperfection and iteration:** Perhaps the most important principle: *Good enough is good enough.* Your second brain will never be perfectly organized, and that’s fine. As one author said, trying to keep everything perfectly organized is futile – instead, focus on making things *findable*  and just keep adding knowledge. Over time, you’ll improve how you organize because you’ll see what’s not working. Let yourself learn by doing. Every few months, you can reflect and adjust (maybe you realize you never look at tags but you always use search – that might mean you stop tagging obsessively and save that energy). This iterative approach is more ADHD-friendly than a big upfront design. Think of your PKM system as a living, growing garden rather than a fixed architecture. You can prune, replant, or weed as you go – but there will always be some overgrowth and that’s okay.

To sum up this section: **Don’t be afraid to personalize.** The best system is one that *you* actually use. It might be 80% PARA with a dash of Zettelkasten linkages, plus a daily journal habit. It might be a full Zettelkasten with a PARA-inspired archive. It might even be a simple notes dump combined with a robust to-do app elsewhere. Use the frameworks as inspiration, not law. As a wise community member said, *Obsidian is a lump of clay – mold it into one form, and if it doesn’t work, smoosh it and try another* . This iterative, forgiving approach is crucial for ADHD brains that thrive on flexibility and balk at boredom or overly strict rules.

Now that we’ve examined the strategies, let’s move to practical steps for applying them in Obsidian.

## **Obsidian Implementation Guide**

This section translates the above strategies into concrete setup tips for your Obsidian vault, focusing on reducing friction and avoiding the common pitfalls that lead to “configuration paralysis.”

### **1.** ****

### **Vault Structure: Folders & Indexes**

**Start simple – minimal folders:** Given your large existing vault, resist the urge to over-sort it in one go. A proven ADHD-friendly setup is:

* **📂 0 Inbox** – a top-level folder where new notes default to (you can set this in Obsidian settings). This is your catch-all for quick captures (if you’re not using Daily Notes for that). It ensures no idea gets lost just because you weren’t sure where to file it. Periodically (say weekly or during a hyperfocus session) process items from here into other categories.
* **📂 1 Projects** – if you’re following PARA or have active projects, keep a folder for them. Within, you might have a folder per project or, if you prefer not to use subfolders, prefix project notes with a project code (whatever lets you group them). *Only keep active projects here.* Once done, move to Archive.
* **📂 2 Areas** – one folder for broad areas of responsibility (personal, work, specific roles). Some people subdivide (e.g., “2 Areas/Work” vs “2 Areas/Personal”). If that granularity helps you, do it – just don’t create dozens of area folders. Remember, the goal is to limit places to look .
* **📂 3 Resources** – one big folder for all reference or knowledge notes. This likely contains the bulk of your vault (all those notes you’ve collected over time). You don’t need many subfolders here; in fact, many Obsidian Zettelkasten users keep all notes in one folder. If you do want to organize Resources, a light-touch approach is Johnny.Decimal or an alphabetical set of subfolders, but tags and MOCs might serve you better for organization *within* this heap. The ADHD-friendly system we saw earlier put a twist here: splitting Resources into “asset base” (files, media) and “knowledge base” (your written notes) . You could mimic that if your vault has lots of attachments or PDF highlights separate from your own writing.
* **📂 4 Archive** – out-of-sight storage for old stuff. This is crucial: stale notes and projects can clutter your working environment, causing distraction or guilt (“oh, I never finished that”). Archiving doesn’t delete them; it just moves them out of your way (you can always search and find them later if needed). You might archive entire project folders with a date appended to the name . Tip: you can exclude the Archive folder from global search (Obsidian search settings allow excluding folders) if you truly want it out of mind, or conversely leave it in search but collapse it in the sidebar.

**Home note / Index:** Create a note (maybe pinned to top) that serves as a dashboard or entry point. For example, a **Home** note that contains:

* Links to key MOCs or indexes (e.g., “📖 Knowledge Index”, “🎯 Active Projects”, “📅 Daily Journal”).
* Possibly a few high-level MOCs listed (like “Health MOC”, “Writing MOC”).
* Maybe a section for “Quick Links” to things you frequently access (important project notes, etc.).
* Keep it clean and minimal so it’s actually useful at a glance.

By having this Home note, you give yourself a starting point every time you open Obsidian, which combats the “Now what do I click on?” feeling. One LYT-inspired example: have three columns or sections for *Atlas* (your knowledge structure notes), *Calendar* (daily/periodic notes), *Efforts* (project/goal notes) . Adapt to what makes sense.

**Note naming conventions:** Consider using some prefixes or emojis to visually distinguish types of notes. For instance:

* Use a 🗒️ emoji or a special character for MOC notes (some use a prefix like “@” or “00_” to sort them at top of folder). E.g., **@Index - Health** or **00 MOC - Writing**. This helps them stand out.
* If you use Daily Notes, they’ll likely be named as dates (2026-01-17). You could keep them in a **Journal** folder (some do **📂 Journal/YYYY/MM/2026-01-17.md** structure), or just in root with date names. Whatever you choose, Obsidian’s Calendar plugin can open them easily.
* If following Johnny.Decimal or PARA naming, keep the numbers or prefixes consistent (e.g., “1_ProjectName - …” so that projects sort together).

The guiding principle is **consistency without overcomplexity**. The moment you feel you’re spending more time organizing than writing, step back.

### **2.** ****

### **Recommended Plugins (and Which to Avoid)**

Obsidian’s plugin ecosystem is vast, and it can be a double-edged sword for ADHD users: exciting but a source of endless tweaking. The advice is to **start with essentials** and only add a plugin when you identify a specific need it solves . Here are some plugins that many ADHD and neurodivergent users have found helpful, and some that might be more trouble than they’re worth initially:

**Essential / Helpful:**

* **Calendar & Periodic Notes:** To manage daily/weekly notes seamlessly. These give you a visual calendar to navigate your journal and can auto-create daily notes with template. Good for establishing a routine.
* **Templater (or core Templates):** Automate repetitive structure. Use it for daily notes (e.g., pre-fill headings or a quote of the day to spark writing) and for note templates (like a standard format for meeting notes or literature notes, so you don’t have to reinvent structure each time). Reducing that “where do I start” friction is a huge help .
* **Dataview:** This plugin is incredibly powerful – it lets you treat your notes like entries in a database. ADHD use-case: *create automatic lists* so you don’t rely on memory. For example, a Dataview query can list all notes with tag #idea created in the last month (so you can review your recent ideas easily). Or list all tasks not done. Or, as one user did, list the 5 most recently edited notes in a section, with their summaries, to help remember what you were last doing . Setting up Dataview can require some tinkering, but you don’t need to be a coder – there are many snippet examples out there. Start with one simple query (maybe “list from #project” to see all project notes). Gradually, you can build dashboards or MOCs enhanced by Dataview. This brings a bit of Notion-like functionality into Obsidian, which can satisfy the desire for overview *without* needing manual updating.
* **Tasks plugin:** If you want to manage tasks within Obsidian (as opposed to a separate app), this plugin can collect tasks from all notes and allow queries like “not done, due before today” etc. It complements daily notes well (log a task on Tuesday, and a “Tasks” view can ensure it shows up in a master list until completed). However, if you already have a task system you like (Todoist, etc.), you might skip this to avoid duplication.
* **Outline (core plugin):** This gives a sidebar with the headings of your current note. It’s very useful if you write long notes or want to navigate a daily note with multiple sections. It provides structure at a glance.
* **Zoom or Longform (for focus):** The Zoom plugin allows you to focus on one section of a note (kind of like Logseq’s feature of zooming into a bullet). As mentioned in the forum, Logseq’s outliner focus was valued by some ADHD users . In Obsidian, Zoom can achieve a similar effect – click into a heading and hide everything else. If you find lots of text overwhelming, use this to narrow your view.
* **Sliding Panes (Andy’s Mode):** This is a cosmetic/workflow plugin that keeps notes open side by side with horizontal scrolling. It lets you have multiple notes visible like a giant desk with papers. Some ADHD folks like this to avoid losing context. Others find it confusing. Try it – if it feels good to see e.g. your MOC note and content note simultaneously, keep it .
* **Quick Capture plugins (QuickAdd):** QuickAdd can create new notes from templates via a hotkey or even append text to an inbox note quickly. If you struggle with capturing thoughts before they vanish, setting up a quick capture command (like Ctrl+Shift+I to open a small window to jot an idea that auto-saves to Inbox) can be great. Alternatively, if using mobile, configure Obsidian’s mobile quick action to open a new note or daily note quickly.

**Safe to Delay (avoid at first):**

* **Highly complex dashboarding plugins:** E.g. **DataviewJS (beyond basics)**, **Canvas for everything**, **Tracker**, etc. These are cool but can lead to spending a ton of time for marginal gain initially. You can do amazing things (like habit trackers, daily review charts), but weigh effort vs reward. Start simple.
* **Too many CSS tweak plugins:** For example, the **Style Settings** (used with Minimal Theme) is helpful, but obsessing over every visual setting can become a rabbit hole. Pick a theme that you find calm and legible (Minimal or Things theme are popular minimalistic ones), tweak a couple fonts or colors if you must, then stop. As one user noted, they chose Minimal theme because it “looks good out of the box” and allowed slight tweaks *“without wasting too much time (ADHD trap)”* .
* **Multiple knowledge graph or AI plugins:** There are community plugins to do AI text generation, advanced relation graphs, etc. These might one day help reorganize or summarize your notes, but at the current stage, they could distract more than help. The **Graph View** (core feature) itself can be stimulating to look at (it gives a dopamine hit seeing your notes web), and it’s enough for now. If you do use Graph, consider pinning a specific local graph (like for a tag or MOC) that’s meaningful, rather than the whole-vault hairball which can be overwhelming.
* **Kanban or Project Mgmt plugins:** Since task management is out of scope, you likely don’t need the Kanban plugin or Projects plugin right away unless you specifically want to manage a project pipeline inside Obsidian. Those can add complexity.

In summary: keep the plugin list lean. A good starter set might be: Calendar, Templates, Dataview, Tasks, and one of either Outliner/Zoom. As you use the system, note any pain points – is something tedious? Is something being forgotten? Then search for a plugin that addresses that. This way, plugins serve you, rather than you bending your workflow around plugins.

### **Templates & Note Setup**

**Daily Note Template:** Create a template for your Daily Notes. Example structure:

```
---
tags: [daily-note, journal]  # frontmatter tags if you use them
---

## Morning
- **Plan:** <!-- Write one or two intent for the day -->

## Notes/Log
- *Evening meeting with team –* discussed Q1 goals (-> see [[Project Alpha]] for follow-up).
- Caught myself procrastinating at 2pm, need to adjust pomodoro.

## Tasks
- [ ] Follow up with HR about forms
- [ ] Research new laptop prices

## Gratitude
- Today I'm thankful for...
```

The above is just an illustration – tailor sections to what you want to track. Some prefer time-block sections (Morning/Afternoon/Evening), others thematic (Work/Personal). One ADHD blogger uses daily notes also to log tiny accomplishments or challenges, which later helps in coaching or therapy contexts – you could add a “Wins” section to list what went well.

The value of a template is that it reduces decision load each morning (you’re not starting from scratch) , and it reminds you of what you intended to capture (if you forget to journal gratitude, the template nudges you).

**Periodic Review Template:** You might create a Weekly or Monthly note template for reflecting and planning. ADHD folks benefit from periodic reflection to adjust strategies. A weekly note template might include:

* Highlights of the week
* Challenges
* Tasks to carry over or delegate
* Next week’s top priorities
  It can be brief bullet points. The act of writing it is more important than the format.

**Project Template:** If you manage projects in Obsidian, have a standard note template for them. E.g. a project note might start with:

```
# Project: XYZ Launch
**Status:** In Progress
**Deadline:** <date>
**Goal:** ... (what does done look like?)

## Plan
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Notes/Research
- [[Note1]] – related insight
- ...
```

Filling in a template like this when you create a new project note ensures you don’t forget to define the goal or list initial tasks. It scaffolds that executive function step of planning.

**Zettelkasten Note Template:** If doing literature notes or permanent notes, you can make a template that includes fields like:

```
**Source:** [[Book/Article name]] (if relevant)  
**Summary:** <1-2 sentence summary>  
**Tags:** #psychology, #adhd  

---

*Write the content/idea here...*

**Connections:** [[Another Note]] on related concept.
```

This way each note has a uniform structure. One ADHD user mentioned they include a “Summary” in metadata for each note and use it in overviews  – that’s a smart practice, because it forces you to succinctly capture what the note is about, which helps both understanding and future retrieval.

The key is, templates should **streamline** your writing, not straitjacket it. If a template section isn’t relevant, you can delete it in that note. The aim is to remove the blank-page syndrome and to ensure important info (like context, source, tags) is recorded consistently  *without relying on memory every time* .

### **Using Daily Notes Without Chaos**

To expand on earlier points, let’s outline a sustainable daily note routine in steps (keeping it short and actionable):

**Step 1: Morning Setup (Optional)** – In the morning, open your daily note (Calendar plugin makes this one click on today’s date). Jot down anything weighing on your mind or the main thing you must do. This is a quick brain dump to start the day with clarity. (If mornings are rushed or groggy for you, this can be skipped or done the night before as “tomorrow prep.”)

**Step 2: Throughout the Day – Quick Logging** – Keep the daily note easily accessible (on phone or PC). Whenever something noteworthy occurs or a task comes up, add a bullet for it. Don’t worry about perfect wording. For example:

* “Idea: Start a [[Blog]] about ADHD and PKM” (you might tag #idea)
* “Meeting with Bob – decided to shift deadline (logged in [[Project XYZ]])”
* “Errand: buy cat food #todo”
  Think of it as leaving breadcrumbs for your future self.

If you spend a lot of time away from keyboard, consider using a mobile app or voice-to-text to capture entries. Some people use Drafts app or iOS Shortcuts to append to daily notes on the fly.

**Step 3: End of Day – 10-minute Review** – Here’s where you prevent the chaos buildup. Take a few minutes (set a timer for 5 or 10, to limit it) to go over today’s notes:

* Tick off completed tasks (nothing more satisfying!).
* If there are tasks you didn’t do and must do later, either move them to tomorrow’s section or mark with something like **>[ ]** (Tasks plugin can consider that a scheduled forward).
* Highlight or bold anything super important you noted, or better, link it to a relevant permanent note. E.g. if you wrote a great insight about your research, copy it into the research note, or at least link the note here.
* Delete or condense trivial stuff if you want (but not necessary).
* Write a one-line summary of the day if you have energy (e.g., “Overall: decent progress, low focus in afternoon”).

Be gentle – ADHD means some days you won’t review at all. That’s okay. Try for at least weekly catch-up if daily fails. The weekly review could look like: go through each daily note of the past week and quickly do the above (check tasks, mark highlights).

**Step 4: Linking and Triaging** – Use the power of Obsidian to make your daily notes not silos. Some additional tips:

* When a daily note entry starts turning into something substantial (say you keep journaling about a book you’re reading each day), that’s a cue to make a separate note for that book and link to it. E.g., on Day 3 of notes about  *Deep Work* , create a note “Book - Deep Work” and move those insights there, leaving behind a pointer.
* Tag patterns: If you notice you often write a certain type of thing, create a tag or consistent keyword for it. For instance, **#idea**, **#quote**, **#dream**, etc. This will allow you to query or compile them. A fun idea: use Dataview to create an “Idea Inbox” table that shows all lines tagged #idea across your vault (sorted by date). That way, even if you never formally process some ideation from daily notes, you have a safety net where they all show up.

**Step 5: Periodic Archival** – Over months and years, daily notes accumulate. You might archive older ones out of the main workspace (e.g., move year 2023 notes into **Journal/2023** folder). But you don’t have to, as long as performance is fine. Some do yearly vault splits, but Obsidian can handle thousands of notes so it’s usually fine to keep them.

One more advanced technique: *Daily note MOC.* For each month or year, you can maintain a note that links all daily notes of that period, maybe with a short comment. For example, a **January 2026** note that lists [[2026-01-01]] – key event or theme, [[2026-01-02]] – etc. This is extra work, but some find it therapeutic to summarize each day in a phrase (forces reflection). And later, if you want to find something but only recall “it was last winter,” these monthly MOCs are quicker to skim than full daily entries. This is entirely optional.

The measure of success for daily notes is: Do you feel less mentally cluttered? Do you trust that if something happened on X date, you have a place to look it up? And does reviewing them feel beneficial, not overwhelming? If daily notes ever start feeling like a burden (you dread writing them), step back and simplify. Maybe you only do a daily note on workdays, or you allow yourself to skip weekends, etc. The system should serve you, not the other way around.

### **Migration & Tooling Advice: Obsidian vs. Logseq vs. Others**

You mentioned being open to migrating to other local-first tools like Logseq. Let’s weigh this decision with an ADHD lens:

**Obsidian Strengths (for ADHD):**

* *Flexibility:* It’s unstructured by default, which can be good (you can build what suits you) but also bad if you’re overwhelmed. However, now that you have clarity on possible structures (PARA, ZK, etc.), Obsidian can implement any of them. You won’t hit a wall – you can start simple and evolve your setup without switching apps again.
* *Speed and simplicity:* It’s just text files. There’s no database overhead, no login – friction to jotting a note is minimal. This immediacy is great for capture (less time for the idea to vanish).
* *Plugins & community:* If your needs change (say you want spaced repetition for studying, or fancy graph analysis), there’s likely a plugin. Also a large community (forums, Discord, Reddit) to get tips specifically about ADHD workflows (and indeed, we mined a lot of those above).
* *Interoperability:* Your vault is Markdown – if you decide to try Logseq or any other MD tool, you can usually use the same files. This means experimenting doesn’t trap you; you could even use Obsidian and Logseq on the same folder (with caution) to see which interface you prefer.

**Logseq Strengths (for ADHD):**

* *Outliner paradigm:* If your brain works better with bullet points and indenting (like a mind mapping or nested tasks style), Logseq might feel more natural. It’s basically an outliner with every bullet being a block that can be referenced. Some ADHD users love outliners (WorkFlowy, Dynalist, etc.) because they enforce a linear train of thought at the moment of writing (one bullet at a time), which can corral scattered thoughts. Logseq also allows zooming into a bullet and focusing, which is great for minimizing distraction .
* *Daily notes centric:* Logseq starts you on a daily journal page by default, which suits those who primarily work chronologically. Everything you enter is under a date unless you specify otherwise, so it’s hard to forget to use daily logging – it’s the home screen. It then lets you tag or link bullets to pages (which are like Obsidian notes) for topics. If you find the daily-first approach comforting and less open-ended, Logseq does that out of the box.
* *Built-in task management:* Logseq has TODO states for bullets and can do queries for tasks without needing plugins. If down the line you want to integrate tasks and notes tightly and not rely on plugins, Logseq might have a smoother setup (e.g., you can have a query of all TODOs on the today page).
* *Clean interface with outlining focus:* For some, Logseq’s UI (which is essentially a text outline + sidebars) feels less tempting to tinker with compared to Obsidian’s myriad of panes and settings. It’s arguable – you can also tweak Logseq, but there are fewer community themes and plugins, which could mean fewer distractions by shiny tools (or conversely, fewer ways to tailor).

**Potential Downsides/Considerations:**

* *Learning curve and migration friction:* Switching to Logseq means learning its commands (indent, outdent, its way of linking – similar [[links]] but it also has tagging by writing [[Tag]] which creates a page). Your current notes can be opened in Logseq, but you might need to add Logseq’s frontmatter or resolve any incompatible syntax. Also, things like embedded files or complex YAML might differ. It’s not terribly hard, but it’s time that could be spent organizing content rather than configuring a new tool.
* *Overwhelm can happen in Logseq too:* A user in the Yaranga article tried both Obsidian and Logseq and found both “too complex to set up” and overwhelming . This underscores that switching tools won’t automatically solve overwhelm – it’s more about the approach. Logseq’s default structure can guide you, but you can also get lost in making countless pages and backlinks. The core challenge (defining a sustainable system) remains, whichever app you use.
* *Reliability:* Both Obsidian and Logseq are generally stable. Obsidian is a bit more mature. Logseq has had some sync issues historically, but if you’re using third-party sync (Dropbox, etc.) it’s similar to Obsidian. In either case, keep backups (which you likely do).
* *Mobile experience:* Obsidian’s mobile app is quite good now. Logseq has a mobile app too but it’s relatively newer. If capturing on the go is important, consider which app’s mobile UI you prefer by trying them.
* *Integration with future AI tools:* This is speculative, but Obsidian’s openness and plugin ecosystem might see more AI integration options (there are already GPT-3 plugins for Obsidian). However, Logseq being block-based might allow more granular AI ops (like an AI that summarizes each bullet). Since you mentioned future LLM-based restructuring, note that both tools ultimately store Markdown, so an AI could work with your files either way. I wouldn’t choose the tool based on AI just yet – you can always export or process the markdown with external scripts.

**Recommendation:** If Obsidian hasn’t fundamentally frustrated you (aside from the initial configuration paralysis), it’s worth sticking with it and implementing the strategies we’ve discussed. You already have a vault – think of it like a house you’ve been collecting materials in. Rather than moving to a new house (Logseq) and unpacking, try renovating the current one room by room. Start applying PARA or MOC or ZK in small sections of your vault. Obsidian can accommodate an outline style too (there’s a core Outline plugin, and you can always just use bullets inside notes).

However, if you try these methods in Obsidian for a while and still feel the interface itself is a barrier (for some, the lack of true outliner paradigm or the temptation of too many options can be an issue), then give Logseq a test run **with a copy of your vault**. See if the outliner approach “clicks” with you. Some ADHD folks report that outlining their thoughts keeps them more focused and that Logseq’s approach of *hiding everything except the bullet you’re on* is great for concentration . If you find that to be a game-changer, you could consider migrating more permanently.

Luckily, migrating between Obsidian and Logseq is not a one-way street: they use the same file format (.md). Logseq will add some **::: logseq** sections in files for properties and might create journals pages. But you can go back and forth relatively easily. You might even adopt a hybrid: e.g. *Use Logseq for daily journaling and quick capture, and Obsidian for long-term knowledge curation.* One forum user did exactly this – using Logseq for daily journal and Obsidian for permanent notes . They cited that Logseq made journaling attractive and easy for them, but they still valued Obsidian for research notes. This is advanced (and requires discipline to not let one slip), so it’s optional, but it shows that it’s not either/or.

**Other tools?** Since you prefer local-first, alternatives include:

* *Joplin:* more of an Evernote replacement, not as good for linking atomic notes.
* *Bear (Mac/iOS only):* beautiful and simple, but proprietary format and not as link-oriented.
* *OneNote:* very freeform and good for multimedia, but not plain text and can get disorganized (and not truly local-first in the same way).
* *Notion:* not local-first (requires cloud), and can be a rabbit hole of over-organization – probably not ideal if Obsidian felt overwhelming.
* *TiddlyWiki:* wiki-like, single HTML file. Powerful and used by some, but perhaps too quirky unless you love wikis.

Given your scenario (already in Obsidian, large MD vault), sticking with Obsidian (or maybe trying Logseq concurrently) is the path of least resistance. The important thing is to implement the workflow changes – folder tweaks, linking habits, etc. – because those will address the overload more than the app itself.

**Future-proofing with AI:** Whichever tool, keep your notes in plain text and well-structured (which you’re doing). That way, future AI tools can easily parse them. For instance, if in a year you decide to use an AI to auto-generate summaries or reorganize content, having atomic notes with clear titles and maybe some metadata will make that easier. You might soon see tools (like the Yaranga app, which is positioning itself as an AI-organized second brain ) that promise to auto-categorize or link your notes. These are exciting but nascent. For now, your best bet is a human-friendly structure – which also tends to be an AI-friendly one. So focusing on the fundamentals (consistent note titles, some frontmatter or tag usage, linking relevant notes) will incidentally prepare you for any AI assistance, because an AI could then identify connections from your links or summarize by reading your neatly separated notes rather than one giant dump.

**Bottom line:** There is no perfect app, just the app that you’ll use. Many ADHD folks eventually realize the tool matters less than building habits and keeping things simple enough to maintain . Obsidian is an excellent tool *if you set guardrails* for yourself (like not installing every plugin at once, not reorganizing the vault at 3am on a whim, etc.). If you find yourself spending more time in “tool tinkering mode” than “note-taking mode,” acknowledge it (without beating yourself up) and maybe impose a little structure: for example,  *only change the system on a scheduled “maintenance day”* , as one person suggested, instead of every time you have an impulse .

You’ve already done the hard part of gathering a lot of knowledge (a large vault is a treasure trove!). Now, with an ADHD-friendly strategy, you can reshape it into a true second brain that  *works with your brain, not against it* . And remember, **messy is okay**. A search-friendly mess beats an empty order. Or as that blogger said, *“no system will magically organize your thoughts for you, but a messy collection of searchable notes beats a perfect system with nothing in it”* . With Obsidian (or Logseq), you now have the means to make your messy notes searchable, connected, and ultimately, useful. Good luck, and enjoy the journey of making the system  *serve you* !
