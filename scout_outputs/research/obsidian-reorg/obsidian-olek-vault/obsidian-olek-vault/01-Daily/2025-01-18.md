## 📝 Notes
Had a great chat with [[Claude]] about organizing my notes. Key insights:
- Don't move line items - TAG them and QUERY them
- Daily notes are the capture layer
- Dataview pulls relevant tasks into project dashboards
- Auto Note Mover is for full notes, not individual tasks

This makes so much more sense than my previous approach.

## 💡 Ideas
#arkai Could build an "Obsidian for PIM teams" consulting offer. Lots of data people struggle with knowledge management.
