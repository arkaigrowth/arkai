# What to do
task: |
  Wire the complete Mac → VPS → Claudia pipeline.

  ## Current State (Verified Working)
  - Mac: Watcher queues voice memos to voice_queue.jsonl ✅
  - VPS: Runner transcribes requests via Groq API ✅ (smoke tested)
  - Claudia: Can respond via Telegram ✅

  ## Missing Glue

  ### 1. Mac → VPS Request Creation
  When `arkai voice process` runs, it should:
  - Read pending items from voice_queue.jsonl
  - Create request JSON in VPS ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/requests/
  - Options:
    A) rsync/scp the request file
    B) Use existing clawdbot webhook to trigger
    C) Direct write via Tailscale mount

  Recommendation: Option B - use webhook, it's already wired.

  ### 2. VPS → Claudia Notification
  When runner completes transcription:
  - Claudia should be notified of new transcripts
  - Options:
    A) Runner calls clawdbot webhook with result
    B) Claudia watches results/ directory
    C) Runner writes to Claudia's memory directly

  Recommendation: Option A - webhook is cleanest.

  ### 3. Claudia Response Flow
  When Claudia gets transcript:
  - Classify intent (NOTE | TASK | IDEA | QUESTION | COMMAND)
  - Write to appropriate location (Obsidian, Claudia memory, etc.)
  - Respond via Telegram if needed

  ## Implementation Tasks

  1. **Modify vps_voice_runner.py**: After writing result, POST to clawdbot
     webhook with transcript summary.

  2. **Add Claudia handler**: In clawdbot gateway or SOUL.md, define how
     Claudia processes incoming voice transcripts.

  3. **Test E2E**: Voice memo on Mac → transcript appears → Claudia responds.

  ## Test Scenario
  ```bash
  # On Mac: Create test voice memo (or use existing)
  touch ~/Library/.../Recordings/test.m4a

  # Watch queue
  tail -f ~/.arkai/voice_queue.jsonl

  # Trigger processing
  arkai voice process --limit 1

  # On VPS: Watch for request/result
  watch 'ls -la ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/{requests,results}/'

  # Verify Claudia got notified (check Telegram or logs)
  ```

# Risk assessment
risk: |
  WEBHOOK AUTH: Clawdbot webhook may require token. Ensure runner has
  CLAWDBOT_TOKEN in environment.

  DUPLICATE PROCESSING: If runner re-processes same request, could spam
  Claudia. Add idempotency check.

  CLAUDIA CONTEXT: Claudia needs to understand voice transcript format.
  May need to update SOUL.md or ARKAI.md.

rollback: |
  If integration breaks existing clawdbot:
    - Disable webhook call in runner
    - Claudia continues working via direct Telegram

error: null

# Notes for clawdbot-builder
handoff_notes: |
  Smoke test verified runner works:
  - Request: ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/requests/smoke-*.json
  - Result: Groq transcription succeeded in ~1 second
  - Audit log captures full trace

  The runner is already running (2 processes). You can test by creating
  request JSON files directly.

  Key question to answer: Should Claudia process voice transcripts
  automatically, or wait for user to ask "what did I say?"
