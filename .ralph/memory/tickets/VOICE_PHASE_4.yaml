# What to do
task: |
  Build the VPS-side voice runner daemon that processes voice requests via Whisper API.

  ## VPS Access
  ```bash
  ssh clawdbot-vps  # or ssh 100.81.12.50 (Tailscale)
  ```

  ## Key Decisions (Already Made)
  - Use Whisper API, NOT local Whisper (VPS has no GPU)
  - Groq primary (free tier), OpenAI fallback ($0.006/min)
  - Owns ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/
  - JSONL audit logging on every action

  ## Build Order

  ### Step 1: Directory Setup (one-time)
  ```bash
  ssh clawdbot-vps "mkdir -p ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/{requests,results,audio-cache}"
  ssh clawdbot-vps "mkdir -p ~/clawd/services/voice"
  ```

  ### Step 2: Create VPS Voice Runner Daemon
  Location: ~/clawd/services/voice/vps_voice_runner.py

  Features:
  - Watchdog file watcher for ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/requests/
  - Process requests: transcribe via Groq (primary) or OpenAI (fallback)
  - Write results to ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/results/
  - JSONL audit log at ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/audit.jsonl
  - Async processing with aiofiles

  ### Step 3: Systemd Service
  Create: ~/.config/systemd/user/vps-voice-runner.service
  - Type=simple
  - Restart=on-failure
  - Environment vars for API keys

  ### Step 4: Test
  ```bash
  # Create test request
  echo '{"id":"test-001","action":"process","params":{"limit":1}}' > \
    ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/requests/test-001.json

  # Watch for result
  cat ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/results/test-001.json

  # Check audit log
  tail ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/audit.jsonl
  ```

  ## Schema Validation (Sync Point)
  When VOICE_PHASE_2_3 completes:
  1. Pull contracts/voice_request.schema.json and voice_result.schema.json
  2. Copy to VPS or import from repo
  3. Add validation calls in process_request()

  If Phase 2+3 not done yet: use inline schema or skip validation temporarily.

  groq_test: |
    ✓ PASS - Groq transcription completed in ~1 second
    Real transcript from Telegram voice memo about fabric patterns

# Risk assessment
risk: |
  API KEYS: GROQ_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY must be set in environment.
  If missing, transcription will fail. Runner should log clear error.

  NO GPU: VPS is ARM64 with no GPU. Local Whisper would be 30-60s per minute
  of audio. API-based approach is correct.

  WATCHDOG DEPENDENCY: Uses python-watchdog. Must be installed:
  pip3 install watchdog aiofiles groq openai jsonschema

  AUDIO FILES: Expects .ogg files in TELEGRAM_INBOUND. If format changes,
  need to update supported extensions.

rollback: |
  If daemon crashes:
    systemctl --user stop vps-voice-runner
    # Debug, fix, restart

  If bad results written:
    rm ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/results/*.json
    # Reprocess requests

  If audit log corrupted:
    mv ~/clawd/artifacts/voice/audit.jsonl audit.jsonl.bak
    # Fresh log on next run

# Dependencies (simplified from spec)
dependencies:
  python_packages:
    - groq        # Primary transcription API
    - openai      # Fallback transcription API
    - jsonschema  # For future schema validation
    # NOTE: watchdog and aiofiles removed - using sync polling instead
  env_vars:
    - GROQ_API_KEY
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
  venv_path: ~/clawd/services/voice/.venv

# Implementation notes (deviations from spec)
implementation_notes: |
  SIMPLIFIED APPROACH (approved by user):
  1. Polling instead of watchdog - matches existing tts-watcher.py pattern
  2. Sync instead of async - Groq/OpenAI clients are sync anyway
  3. Transcripts stored INLINE in result JSON - no data loss
  4. Atomic claim via .inflight/ directory - prevents double-processing
  5. Idempotency check - skip if result exists with status=completed
  6. Bounded retries (3 attempts) with 2s delay
  7. Fail-fast startup if no API keys configured
  8. 24h retention cleanup on audio-cache at startup
  9. Crash recovery - moves .inflight/ files back to requests/ on restart

  API keys stored securely:
  - ~/clawd/services/voice/.env with chmod 600
  - Loaded via systemd EnvironmentFile directive
  - Keys fetched from macOS Keychain, not stored in git

# Sync point with Phase 2+3
sync_notes: |
  This ticket can start immediately but needs schemas from VOICE_PHASE_2_3.

  Options:
  1. Inline validation schemas temporarily → swap when Phase 2+3 merges
  2. Skip validation initially → add after Phase 2+3 merges
  3. Wait for Phase 2+3 to commit schemas first (slower but cleaner)

  Recommended: Start building, skip schema validation. Add validation as
  final step after Phase 2+3 schemas are available.
